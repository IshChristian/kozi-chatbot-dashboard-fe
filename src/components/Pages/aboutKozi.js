INDUSTRY OVERVIEW 
The domestic worker industry is essential for urban and rural areas, providing services like 
housekeeping and childcare. In Rwanda, it offers jobs for those without formal education but 
with valuable skills. However, challenges include a lack of formal job placement, inadequate 
worker protections, and limited rights. 
Kozi addresses these issues by connecting skilled workers with clients reliably. Our goal is to 
enhance job opportunities, improve service quality, and create secure relationships between 
workers and clients, ensuring professionalism and safety in the domestic work sector.
